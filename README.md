# Skin Disease Classification using Custom CNN  

A deep learning project that classifies skin diseases using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **HAM10000 dataset**. The model achieves **98.96% test accuracy**, outperforming traditional baselines.  

---

## Features  
- Custom CNN architecture designed for efficiency and accuracy  
- Handles **7 different skin disease classes**  
- High accuracy on unseen test data (generalizes well)  
- Data preprocessing, augmentation, and visualization included  
- Evaluation with **confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy/loss plots**

## Dataset: HAM10000  
The **HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset** is a large collection of **dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions**.  
It includes **7 classes**:  

1. **Melanocytic nevi (nv)**  
2. **Melanoma (mel)**  
3. **Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)**  
4. **Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)**  
5. **Actinic keratoses (akiec)**  
6. **Vascular lesions (vasc)**  
7. **Dermatofibroma (df)**
